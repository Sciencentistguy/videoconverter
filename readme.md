# VideoConverter
This is a python script to convert video files to the format and codec that I use for my Plex server. This is:
* Video: h.264
* Audio: aac or flac
* Subtitles: dvd, pgs, or ssa

It can also rename TV show files to [Plex's naming scheme](https://support.plex.tv/articles/naming-and-organizing-your-tv-show-files/).
